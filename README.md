The Cleaning Medicine Names Dataset is a curated collection of medicine name examples designed 
for training and testing models that clean, standardize, or normalize medicine names (e.g., removing spelling variations, 
brand vs. generic mismatches, typos, etc.).
This dataset can help with:
Text preprocessing for healthcare and pharmacy applications
Named-entity recognition (NER) for medicine names
Data cleaning and normalization pipelines in biomedical NLP

Use it for:
Machine learning model training
Spell correction or fuzzy matching experiments
Standardizing drug names in healthcare data systems

Medicine names are often misspelled or inconsistent across data sources. This dataset aims to help developers 
and researchers build better tools for automatic medicine name standardization, improving data quality and 
interoperability in healthcare applications.

This dataset is licensed under the CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication) — feel free to use, modify, and share it for any purpose.
